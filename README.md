## General Info
For my capstone project Iâ€™d like to analyze U.S. food import trend-based amount spent, volume and effect of growing population, inflation and recession. At least 20 years of annual data are included, enabling users to track long-term growth patterns.

## Motivation

I wanted to discover the story behind what we spend on importing food. Understand how the number of people and the total food we import are connected. Explore the favorite foods with the Top 10 Food Imports, and learn about the rising or falling prices with Food Inflation.

##  Cleaning Data

### Python
-  Changed rows to columns using transpose.
-  Dropped extra columns I did not need.
-  Deleted years that were unusable.
-  Merged data frames to create one continous dataframe to show Population and U.S. food import.
-  Remaning the columns.
-  Chanded Data type.
-  Loading data into Power bi, building dashboards-

### Excel
-  Removed extra rows above data and header row in .xlsx files from wits.worldbank.org
